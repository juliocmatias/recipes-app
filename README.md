# Welcome RecipeApp Repository

<details>
  <summary><strong>Summary</strong></summary>

This is a responsive web application for mobile devices, developed during my training at [trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/). Its purpose is to search for food and drink recipes, as well as a page to follow a recipe step by step and favorite it. It also has a login page to access the application.
Using the APIs:
[Meals](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) e [Cocktail](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)

This project was developed in a sprint, where my class was divided into a group of 6 people. We had to organize ourselves to deliver the project on time, in addition to trying to maintain organization. In a learning environment this can be tricky, but we can do it. To do this, we use Kanban on Trello and communicate a lot through the Slack application.

After we started looking for a challenge, I decided to develop it alone to test my abilities and this was the result.

Although this application, after finishing the evaluation period, I did it alone, a good part of the styling and even some ideas about the codes I got from my teammates who helped me during the development. I leave here a caveat for everyone.
