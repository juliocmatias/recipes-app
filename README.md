***Responsive Recipes Application for Mobile Devices - Front-End***

## :writing_hand: Summary

***This is a responsive web application for mobile devices, developed during my training at [trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/). Its purpose is to search for food and drink recipes, as well as a page to follow a recipe step by step and favorite it. It also has a login page to access the application.***
***Using the APIs:***
***[Meals](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) e [Cocktail](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)***

***This project was developed in a sprint, where my class was divided into a group of 6 people. We had to organize ourselves to deliver the project on time, in addition to trying to maintain organization. In a learning environment this can be tricky, but we can do it. To do this, we use Kanban on Trello and communicate a lot through the Slack application.***

***After we started looking for a challenge, I decided to develop it alone to test my abilities and this was the result.***

## :rocket: ****Technology used****

  - *We used Kanban Trello as an agile methodology to better organize the tasks that each person would perform, this gave us an idea of what a real sprint would be like in the workplace.*

## üëä Authors and acknowledgment

*This project was followed by requirements pre-established by [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/), only the implementations are my own.*
